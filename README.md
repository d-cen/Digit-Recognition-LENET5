# Project: Digit Recognizer with modified LeNet-5
Apply computer vision fundamentals with the famous MNIST data (Kaggle)

## Description
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

The project implementation follows LeNet-5 from "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition" by Y-Lecun with several modifications, and achieved maximum of 99.6% with digit recognition.

## Goal
The goal is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is.
For every in the test set, predict the correct label.

## Metric
This project is evaluated on the categorization accuracy of your predictions (the percentage of images you get correct).
